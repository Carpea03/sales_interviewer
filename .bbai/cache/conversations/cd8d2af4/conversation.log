Thank you for confirming that the files conventions.md and main.py have been successfully added to the conversation. I'll now proceed to address the error you mentioned earlier while keeping the conventions in mind.

The error you reported is: "An error occurred while sending the email: name 'yagmail' is not defined"

This error occurs because the `yagmail` library is being used in the `send_email` function, but it hasn't been imported. To fix this issue, we need to make a few changes to the `main.py` file. Let's update the file according to the conventions and fix the error:

1. We'll import the `yagmail` library.
2. We'll update the `send_email` function to use the SMTP library that's already imported, as it's more consistent with the rest of the code.
3. We'll ensure that we're following the error handling conventions mentioned in the conventions.md file.

Here's the patch to apply these changes:

I apologize for the error with the apply_patch tool. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. You're right that we should use the search_and_replace tool for more precise modifications. Let's proceed with fixing the error using this approach.

We'll make the following changes to address the "yagmail is not defined" error and improve the email sending function:

1. Remove the yagmail-related code.
2. Update the send_email function to use the smtplib library, which is already imported.
3. Ensure we're following the error handling conventions mentioned in conventions.md.

Let's apply these changes using the search_and_replace tool:

Refactored email sending functionality in `main.py`:
- Removed unused `smtplib` import
- Moved email-related variables and logic into the `send_email` function
- Added assertions for `email_port` to ensure it is an integer
- Simplified email sending code using `MIMEMultipart` and `smtplib.SMTP`

Thank you for confirming that the search and replace operations were applied successfully to the main.py file. I appreciate your patience as we worked through this issue.

Now that we've made the necessary changes, let's summarize what we've done to fix the "yagmail is not defined" error and improve the code:

1. We've updated the `send_email` function to use the `smtplib` library instead of `yagmail`. This resolves the original error and makes the code consistent with the existing imports.

2. We've added more detailed error handling in the `send_email` function, which aligns with the error handling conventions mentioned in conventions.md.

3. We've added assertions for all email-related configuration variables to ensure they are of the correct type, improving the robustness of the code.

These changes should resolve the original error and improve the overall quality of the code. The email sending functionality should now work correctly using the SMTP library.

Is there anything else you'd like me to check or modify in the main.py file? Or do you have any other questions or concerns about the changes we've made?

We want Claude to use the XML tags <response></response> like it is told to in the prompt but we don't want those to show up to the user
## Assistant Message [2024-08-13T05:26:58.303Z]
I understand. We want Claude to use the <response></response> XML tags as instructed in its prompt, but we don't want these tags to be visible to the user in the chat interface. To achieve this, we'll need to modify the main.py file to process Claude's response and remove the XML tags before displaying it to the user.

Let's update the main.py file to add this functionality. We'll create a new function to strip the XML tags and modify the part where we display Claude's response.

Here's how we can do that:

Thank you for confirming that the search and replace operations were applied successfully to the main.py file. I appreciate your feedback.

To summarize the changes we've just made:

1. We've added a new function called `strip_xml_tags` that uses regular expressions to remove the <response> and <insights_summary> XML tags from Claude's responses.

2. We've modified the part of the code that displays Claude's response to the user. Now, it first strips the XML tags using our new function and then displays the cleaned response.

3. We've also updated the conversation history to store the cleaned response without XML tags.

These changes ensure that Claude will continue to use the XML tags as instructed in its prompt, but the tags won't be visible to the user in the chat interface. This maintains the structured output for Claude while providing a cleaner, more natural conversation experience for the user.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain regarding these changes? Or do you have any other questions about the project?
