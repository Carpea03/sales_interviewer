Code Style and Formatting\n\nThis project will follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.\n\nRationale:\n- Official Python style guide\n- Widely adopted in the Python community\n- Improves code readability and consistency\n\nKey points to follow:\n- Use 4 spaces for indentation\n- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters\n- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions\n- Use docstrings for modules, functions, classes, and methods\n- Follow the naming conventions:\n  - Functions and variables: lowercase with underscores (snake_case)\n  - Classes: CapitalizedWords (PascalCase)\n  - Constants: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES\n- Always use UTF-8 encoding for Python source files\n\nTools:\n- Consider using tools like flake8 or pylint for style checking\n- Use an IDE or editor with PEP 8 support for real-time feedback\n```\n\nNow, let's move on to the next important aspect of our project conventions.\n\n3. Version Control and Branching Strategy\n\nEstablishing a clear version control and branching strategy is crucial for collaborative development. Here are some common options:\n\na) GitHub Flow:\nPros:\n- Simple and straightforward\n- Encourages frequent releases\n- Works well for continuous deployment\n\nCons:\n- May not be suitable for projects with long-running versions\n\nb) GitFlow:\nPros:\n- Provides a structured approach for feature development, releases, and hotfixes\n- Works well for projects with scheduled releases\n\nCons:\n- More complex than GitHub Flow\n- Can be overkill for smaller projects\n\nc) Trunk-Based Development:\nPros:\n- Simplifies the development process\n- Reduces merge conflicts\n- Facilitates continuous integration and delivery\n\nCons:\n- Requires disciplined developers and good test coverage\n- May not suit projects with long-running features\n\nWhich version control and branching strategy would you prefer for this project, Alex?

Programming Language\n\nThis project will use Python as the primary and only programming language.\n\nRationale:\n- Consistent with the current implementation\n- Excellent support for data processing and AI/ML tasks\n- Extensive libraries and frameworks available (e.g., Streamlit, OpenAI)\n- Easy to read and maintain\n\n## 2.

Testing Strategy\n\nThis project will use Unit Testing with pytest as its primary testing strategy.\n\nRationale:\n- Widely used in the Python community\n- Powerful and flexible\n- Good for testing individual components\n\nKey points:\n- Write unit tests for all new functions and classes\n- Aim for high test coverage (suggest a specific percentage, e.g., 80%)\n- Use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown\n- Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios\n- Mock external dependencies when necessary\n- Run tests before each commit and in CI/CD pipeline\n- Name test files with `test_` prefix (e.g., `test_utils.py`)\n- Name test functions with `test_` prefix (e.g., `test_validate_email()`)\n\nTools:\n- pytest for writing and running tests\n- pytest-cov for measuring code coverage\n- Consider using tox for testing in multiple environments\n\n## 5. Documentation Standards\n\nThis project will use inline comments and docstrings as the primary documentation method.\n\nRationale:\n- Documentation is close to the code it describes\n- Easy to keep up-to-date when making code changes\n- Supports auto-generated API documentation\n\nKey points:\n- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, functions, and methods\n- Follow the Google Python Style Guide for docstring formatting\n- Include a brief description, arguments, return values, and examples in docstrings\n- Use inline comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions\n- Keep comments and docstrings up-to-date when changing code\n- Use type hints to improve code readability and enable better tooling support\n\nExample docstring format:\n```python\ndef function_name(arg1: type1, arg2: type2) -> return_type:\n    \"\"\"Short description.\n\n    Longer description if necessary.\n\n    Args:\n        arg1: Description of arg1.\n        arg2: Description of arg2.\n\n    Returns:\n        Description of return value.\n\n    Raises:\n        ExceptionType: Why this exception is raised.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> function_name(42, 'foo')\n        'bar'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Function implementation here\n```\n\nTools:\n- Consider using Sphinx for generating documentation from docstrings\n- Use a linter like pydocstyle to check docstring formatting\n\n## 6. Dependency Management\n\nThis project will use requirements.txt with pip for dependency management.\n\nRationale:\n- Simple and widely used\n- Easy to understand and maintain\n\nKey points:\n- Maintain a requirements.txt file in the root of the project\n- List all direct dependencies with their versions\n- Use pip to install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n- Update requirements.txt when adding or updating dependencies\n- Consider using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to capture all nested dependencies\n- For development-specific dependencies, consider maintaining a separate `requirements-dev.txt` file\n\nBest practices:\n- Pin dependency versions to ensure reproducibility\n- Regularly update dependencies to get bug fixes and security updates\n- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies\n\nExample requirements.txt:\n```\nstreamlit==1.2.0\nopenai==0.27.0\ntornado==6.1\n```\n\nTools:\n- pip for installing dependencies\n- Consider using pip-tools for more advanced dependency management\n```\n\nThis completes our conventions.md file with all the key decisions we've made for the project.
