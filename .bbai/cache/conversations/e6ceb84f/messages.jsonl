There is no code that deletes or removes conversation files.\n\nThe `save_conversation` function is called after each user input and assistant response, ensuring that the entire conversation is preserved.\n\nTo address your original concern about conversations not being saved, I can confirm that:\n\n1. Conversations are indeed being saved.\n2. They are saved in a structured manner with timestamps.\n3. There is no automatic deletion of conversation files.\n\nThe only potential issue I see is in the `end_conversation` function, which resets the conversation history in the session state. However, this doesn't affect the saved conversation files. If you want to ensure that users can continue from where they left off in previous sessions, we might need to modify this function to load the previous conversation history from the saved file.\n\nWould you like me to make any further modifications to the conversation saving process or the `end_conversation` function? Or do you have any other concerns about how conversations are being handled?"},"timestamp":"2024-08-13T05:43:29.897Z"}
